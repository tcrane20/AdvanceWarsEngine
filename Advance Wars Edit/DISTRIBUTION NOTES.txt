Remove any need for RTP things

In the FMod script, comment out the line that tries to search for the RTP folder (below line 735)

Configuration settings should not request Standard RTP package

AW_Font needs to be installed.

RGSS102E.dll needs to be in the folder

A user reported that the RGSS3 version 3.0.0.1 did not work but version 3.0.1.1 did. Research will be necessary.
